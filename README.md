# 11_Development-of-AI-Driven-Code-Reviewer
Reviewing code manually for correctness, coding style, and optimization is time-consuming, especially in academic or training environments where students submit large volumes of assignments. This project aims to build an AI-powered tool that automatically reviews student code submissions. The system will check for syntax errors, logical issues, coding style adherence, and suggest optimizations. By combining AI models (GPT API) with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, the solution will provide detailed feedback to help students improve their coding practices.
Outcomes
●	Error Detection: Identify syntax and logical errors in code.
●	Coding Style Review: Highlight deviations from coding standards (e.g., PEP8 for Python).
●	Optimization Suggestions: Recommend improvements in performance and readability.
●	Automated Feedback: Reduce manual evaluation effort for instructors.
●	Student-Friendly Tool: Allow students to paste or upload code and instantly get actionable insights.
