# 11_Development-of-AI-Driven-Code-Reviewer
This project aims to build an AI-powered tool that automatically reviews student code submissions. The system will check for syntax errors, logical issues, coding style adherence, and suggest optimizations. The solution will provide detailed feedback to help students improve their coding practices.
